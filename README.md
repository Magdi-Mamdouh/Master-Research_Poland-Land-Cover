# Master-Research_Poland-Land-Cover
This is my script of my Master research work for creating a Machine Learning land cover classification and change detection of the territory of Poland. 
The model is deployed using Google Earth Engine. 
The study is based on using optical data from Sentinel_2 satallite and SAR data from Sentinel_1 C-Band.
